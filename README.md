<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project


I have often had the need to improve my productivity, and despite because of the multitude of applications that allow you to do this I thought I would write my own timer. This way you can keep track of your work time and avoid distractions. But the main reason I did this is to have the possibility to extend it in such a way that I can trigger different actions during the different phases (blocking distractions, activating noises for concentration etc.).

The main purpose of the project is to create a simple and customisable timer.
